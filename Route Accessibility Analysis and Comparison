Route and Accessibility Analysis and Comparison (PostGIS + QGIS)

A spatial analytics project evaluating public transport accessibility in Burwood and Clayton South suburbs of Melbourne using SQL-based spatial queries and QGIS visualizations. 
The goal was to identify underserved zones and analyze differences between a university-centered suburb (Burwood) and a less transit-focused one (Clayton South).

Key Features:
  * Spatial Data Integration: Loaded and processed GTFS data and Australian suburb boundaries into PostgreSQL/PostGIS using `ogr2ogr`.
  
  * Transport Mode Analysis: Mapped tram, bus, and train routes within suburb boundaries using spatial clipping (`ST_Within`, `ST_Intersection`).
  
  * Accessibility Buffering: Created 500m buffer zones around stops/routes to determine walkable coverage areas.
  
  * Gap Identification: Calculated non-accessible regions using `ST_Difference`, highlighting transit service disparities.
  
  * Visualization: Developed thematic maps in QGIS for accessible vs. non-accessible zones and transport mode overlays.

The project demonstrates expertise in spatial SQL, geospatial data processing, and transport equity analysis using open-source tools and real-world datasets.
