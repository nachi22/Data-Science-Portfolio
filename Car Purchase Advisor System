Car Purchase Advisor System

A Python-based interactive command-line application that simulates a car dealership advisory and ordering system with built-in test data generation. 
Key features include:
* Automated Data Generation: On startup, randomized car stock data is created and stored in `stock.txt`, then loaded into program memory.

* Interactive Menu: 
      Users can:
        * Find the nearest car retailer based on postcode proximity.
        * Receive tailored car purchase advice from selected retailers.
        * Place car orders (validated against retailer business hours).
        * Exit the program.

* Retailer Search & Advice Options:   
    Includes:
      * Recommending a random car from stock.
      * Viewing all cars or filtering by type (e.g., “AWD”, “RWD”).
      * Displaying cars suitable for probationary licence holders.

* Order Processing: Validates input and operating hours before writing confirmed orders to `order.txt`.

This system showcases structured file handling, input validation, randomness, conditional logic, and menu-driven interaction.
