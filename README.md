# 👋 Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Nachiket Talwar** — this portfolio showcases real-world data science projects built across Python, R, SQL, and GIS environments. Each project demonstrates practical solutions to complex problems using domain-specific data, statistical modeling, spatial analytics, and interactive dashboards.

### 🔍 What You’ll Find Here:

* **Public Health Analytics**:
  An interactive R Shiny dashboard analyzing chronic disease risk factors like diabetes and heart disease using PCA, clustering, and comparative plots.

* **Property Investment Automation**:
  A Python-based CLI tool that streamlines property investment decisions with suburb summaries, currency conversion, and price distribution analysis.

* **Car Purchase Advisory System**:
  A simulated console program for car recommendations and retailer ordering, with business-hour logic and local file integration.

* **Transport Accessibility Mapping**:
  A spatial SQL and QGIS project comparing public transport coverage in two Melbourne suburbs using GTFS data, route clipping, and buffer-based accessibility zones.

### 💼 Tools & Skills Highlighted:

* Python (OOP, pandas, matplotlib, NumPy)
* R & R Shiny (ggplot2, plotly, clustering)
* SQL & PostGIS (spatial queries, buffers, intersections)
* QGIS (visual mapping)

# Automation of Property Investment (Python)

A Python-based, menu-driven console application designed to automate administrative tasks for a property investment company using real estate sales data from Melbourne. Built with object-oriented design principles, the program simplifies data analysis and investor decision-making.
Core Functionalities:
  * Data Import & Cleaning: Loads property data and prepares it for analysis.
  
  * Currency Conversion: Converts property prices to international currencies using dynamic exchange rates.
  
  * Suburb Summaries: Generates statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of property features by suburb.

  * Land Size Analysis: Computes average land size by suburb, handling unit variations and missing data.

  * Value Distribution: Visualizes property prices across suburbs using histograms (multi-currency support).

  * Sales Trend Visualization: Plots annual property sales trends via line charts.

  * Price Search Tool: Implements reverse insertion sort and recursive binary search to locate properties by price within a suburb.

This project showcases robust Python programming skills, data manipulation using pandas and NumPy, and visualization with matplotlib. The system demonstrates error handling, user input validation, and compliance with PEP 8 standards.
